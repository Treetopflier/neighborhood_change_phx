The Census 2000 census tract relationship files are in fixed length ASCII format. The two census tract relationship files consist of one record per each 1990 census tract/2000 census tract spatial set. A spatial census tract set is defined as the area that is uniquely shared between a 1990 census tract and a 2000 census tract. The two files of significantly changed census tracts consist only of a list of census tracts that exhibited a change of 2.5-percent or greater. The current release includes 56 sets of files, one set for each of the 50 states plus separate files for the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

The file naming convention is in parenthesis below after the file name. The "xx" represents the 2-character Post Office state abbreviation and "NN" represents the 2-digit state FIPS code.

Census 2000 - Census Tract Relationship Files

As part of the Census 2000 geographic product series, the Census Bureau has produced Census Tract Relationship Files. (In previous censuses, this product was called a comparability file.) These files show how 1990 census tracts relate to Census 2000 census tracts. The files consist of one record per each 1990 census tract/2000 census tract spatial set. A spatial census tract set is defined as the area that is uniquely shared between a 1990 census tract and a 2000 census tract.

The Census Tract Relationship Files consist of four sets of files. The purpose of these files is to assist users in determining the relationships between 1990 and 2000 census tracts. Two of these files are state-level entity based census tract relationship files. One file provides a measurement of change based on population; a second measures change using street-side mileage. The other two files specifically list census tracts that have experienced significant change:  one file from the perspective of 1990 census tracts, the other from the perspective of Census 2000. All four census tract relationship files will be available for each state-level entity as well as at the national level.

Census 2000 - Census Tract Relationship File Descriptions
Population-based Census Tract Relationship Files
Each state-level entity file is comprised of a record for each unique spatial 1990/2000 census tract area combination within the state. In addition to the 1990 and 2000 census tract codes, each record contains three population figures; the Census 2000 population for the record, the Census 2000 population for the entire 2000 census tract, and the actual or estimated Census 2000 population for the area of the 1990 census tract (not the 1990 population for the 1990 census tract). Also, to identify changes and the proportion of change, the record includes "part" indicators for both the 1990 and 2000 census tracts, and the percent of the Census 2000 population represented for the 1990 and 2000 census tracts represented in that record.

Note: As part of the procedure to provide 2000 population data for 1990 census tracts, the Census Bureau has rounded the Census 2000 tabulation block population data for some of the blocks that are split by 1990 census tract boundaries. This rounding procedure may create individual census tract, county, and/or state population totals that are slightly different from the official Census 2000 population totals. Also, the Census 2000 population for the 1990 census tract and for the record is an estimate for each 1990 census tract that had a 1990 boundary not identical to a Census 2000 census block boundary.


Street-side Mileage-based Census Tract Relationship Files
This file type is almost identical to the population-based census tract relationship files, except that these files use street-side mileage, rather than population, as a means to measure relationship.


Significantly Changed 1990 Census Tracts Files
This file type lists those 1990 census tracts that have exhibited a change of 2.5-percent or more for 2000. It uses the data contained in the population-based census tract relationship file.

Note: The amount of change of 2.5-percent or greater can reflect either a sum of gain or loss of Census 2000 population within a given census tract.


Significantly Changed 2000 Census Tracts Files
This file type lists all 2000 census tracts that had more than 2.5-percent of their Census 2000 population in a different 1990 census tract.

Note: This file was generated by using the national population-based file to identify all 2000 census tracts that did not have 97.5% of their population in a 1990 census tract with the same number.
