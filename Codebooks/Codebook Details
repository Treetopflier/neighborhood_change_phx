Specifically, the 'variable' hyperlink was accessed which redirected us to a new website containing the variable names in a single, large table.

The "Select All" feature was used, the information copied to the computer clipboard, and subsequently pasted into LibreOffice Calc version 6.0.7.3 and saved as a .csv file.
The Row totals were then compared to ensure data integrity.

This process was repeated for each of the files listed above.
